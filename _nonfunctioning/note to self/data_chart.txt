so, it looks like if my dataframe has columns of archetype name != 'other', and win_percent, and meta_percent, I could do something like this:
sort the df descending based upon meta percent

import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
sns.barplot(x="win_percent", y="archetype_name", data=df, orient="h")

I would then need to save this to a variable, convert to a jpg, then message the output (see ATEST)
