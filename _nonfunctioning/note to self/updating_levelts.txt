Steps to updating:
1) Loop through stores
2) find the store level
3) Update the store IF THE LEVEL IS NOT THE SAME and return store info
4) If info is returned, this means that the level changed and the owner should be updated
5) if no info is returned, the level did not change and the owner does not need to be updated
