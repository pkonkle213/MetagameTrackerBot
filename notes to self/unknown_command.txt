DONE - Current state: select all archetypes that are 'UNKNOWN'

Future state: select with the fancy LEFT OUTER JOIN, then from that CTE select all rows that are null for archetype_played

Command should take in discord_id, game, format to query
Ultimate output should be date (ordered desc) and player name (ordered asc)
