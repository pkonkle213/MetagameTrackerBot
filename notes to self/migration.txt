I need to delete the "archetype_played" column from participants.
This requires me to update the inputtracker so that archetypes aren't lost
DONE - I'll probably need to download each table and fill out an excel sheet to get all the UPDATE scripts needed, which will be SUPER fun to run one by one
inputtracker will become archetypesplayed, recording the same information
